        <h1>Development Portfolio: UrbanRoot Competitive Analysis</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="development">
        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this project, I conducted competitive research on major e-commerce brands like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy to identify effective strategies for organizing and aggregating information. From this analysis, I developed UrbanRoot, an innovative e-commerce platform that integrates sustainable, ethical, and creative products. UrbanRoot enhances the shopping experience by seamlessly integrating thoughtful filtering, sorting, and aggregation features, catering to the values and lifestyle preferences of millennial consumers.</p>
        <h3>Assignment Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice conducting competitive analysis between competitor companies</li>
            <li>Create a functional aggregator interface using React</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>II. Role</h2>
        <p>In my role as a UI/UX designer, I conducted a competitive analysis of three e-commerce websites, identifying effective organizational methods and aggregators for inspiration. Leveraging these insights, I crafted a unique brand identity and website concept for a new e-commerce platform. Subsequently, I translated these designs into a minimum viable product (MVP) website, seamlessly integrating effective methods to enhance the user experience.</p>

        <h3>V. Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Relevant filters, such as eBay's option to filter by seller location, proved effective in enhancing user experience.</li>
            <li>Aggregator features like favorites, save later, or watchlist significantly contribute to user engagement and convenience.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/new-browser-windows-and-tabs/">Nielsen Norman Group's</a> recommendation to redirect users within the same tab was considered for improving user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>VI. Implementation Considerations for UrbanRoots</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Include filters for attributes like organic, vegan, and recyclable materials.</li>
            <li>Offer sorting options based on price. This is a feature featured on all 3 websites.</li>
            <li>Showcase trending eco-friendly products and curated collections on the homepage.The presence of terms like "Sustainable", "Eco-Friendly", and "Vegan" in the dropdown menu of categories reflects the focus on environmentally friendly and ethically conscious products. Much like how eBay has a selection for location because their delivery is based off of location</li>
            <li>Streamline the checkout process where you can view and quickly remove items in your cart.</li>
        </ul>
