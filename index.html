    </header>

    <section class="development">
        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this project, I conducted competitive research on major e-commerce brands like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy to identify effective strategies for organizing and aggregating information. From this analysis, I developed UrbanRoot, an innovative e-commerce platform that integrates sustainable, ethical, and creative products. UrbanRoot enhances the shopping experience by seamlessly integrating thoughtful filtering, sorting, and aggregation features, catering to the values and lifestyle preferences of millennial consumers.</p>
        <h3>Assignment Objectives</h3>

            <li>Practice conducting competitive analysis between competitor companies</li>

        <h2>II. Role</h2>
        <p>In my role as a UI/UX designer, I conducted a competitive analysis of three e-commerce websites, identifying effective organizational methods and aggregators for inspiration. Leveraging these insights, I crafted a unique brand identity and website concept for a new e-commerce platform. Subsequently, I translated these designs into a minimum viable product (MVP) website, seamlessly integrating effective methods to enhance the user experience.</p>

        <h3>V. Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Relevant filters, such as eBay's option to filter by seller location, proved effective in enhancing user experience.</li>
            <li>Aggregator features like favorites, save later, or watchlist significantly contribute to user engagement and convenience.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/new-browser-windows-and-tabs/">Nielsen Norman Group's</a> recommendation to redirect users within the same tab was considered for improving user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>VI. Justifications for Implementation Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Include filters for attributes like organic, vegan, and recyclable materials:</strong> Catering to environmentally conscious consumers by offering sustainable product options. This aligns with the target audience's values and preferences, enhancing the appeal of the platform and potentially increasing user engagement and loyalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer sorting options based on price:</strong> Price is a fundamental sorting criterion for users to find products within their budget. Providing this option ensures that users can easily locate products that meet their affordability criteria, thereby improving the overall shopping experience and satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Showcase trending eco-friendly products and curated collections on the homepage:</strong> Highlighting environmentally friendly products aligns with UrbanRoot's mission and attracts the target audience, which is likely interested in sustainable and ethical purchasing. Additionally, featuring curated collections adds a personalized touch and facilitates product discovery, increasing user engagement and retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamline the checkout process where you can view and quickly remove items in your cart:</strong> Enhancing user convenience by providing a hassle-free checkout experience. Allowing users to easily view and remove items from their cart streamlines the purchasing process, reducing friction and increasing the likelihood of completing transactions. This improves user satisfaction and encourages repeat purchases.</li>
