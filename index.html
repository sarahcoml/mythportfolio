        <h1>Development Portfolio: UrbanRoot Competitive Analysis</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="development">
        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this project, I conducted competitive research on major e-commerce brands like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy to identify effective strategies for organizing and aggregating information. From this analysis, I developed UrbanRoot, an innovative e-commerce platform that integrates sustainable, ethical, and creative products. UrbanRoot enhances the shopping experience by seamlessly integrating thoughtful filtering, sorting, and aggregation features, catering to the values and lifestyle preferences of millennial consumers.</p>
        <h3>Assignment Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice conducting competitive analysis between competitor companies</li>
            <li>Create a functional aggregator interface using React</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>II. Role</h2>
        <p>In my role as a UI/UX designer, I conducted a competitive analysis of three e-commerce websites, identifying effective organizational methods and aggregators for inspiration. Leveraging these insights, I crafted a unique brand identity and website concept for a new e-commerce platform. Subsequently, I translated these designs into a minimum viable product (MVP) website, seamlessly integrating effective methods to enhance the user experience.</p>
